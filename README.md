# shortguidetoreseller
This Github repository has been created to keep track of the progress of my short guide to reseller hosting.
I will update this repository whenever an important milestone/update regarding this project is reached/available.

Any feedback, ideas or words of advice are appreciated and will be considered.
Please understand that I will still follow my idea of how the book will be like and where I put the emphasis on.
There may come a time where I especially ask for input regarding on where to put the emphasis of a certain topic where you will be given the possibility to actively shape the book with me. If there is anything in specific you would like to see covered by this book don't hesitate to reach out as I will give thought to and actually consider any fair suggestion conveyed. 

Kind regards,

Ympker / Nicolas
